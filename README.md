# AI Customer Support Bot

An intelligent customer support system that uses AI to handle FAQs, maintain conversational context, and automatically escalate complex queries to human agents.

## Features

- **24/7 AI Support**: Instant responses to customer queries using FAQ matching and contextual understanding
- **Conversational Memory**: Retains conversation history throughout each session for coherent interactions
- **Smart Escalation**: Automatically escalates to human agents when:
  - User explicitly requests human assistance
  - Query remains unresolved after multiple attempts
  - Complex issues are detected
- **Session Management**: Track all conversations with status indicators (active, resolved, escalated)
- **FAQ Knowledge Base**: Pre-loaded with 15 common questions covering shipping, returns, payments, and more
- **Real-time Chat Interface**: Modern, responsive UI with typing indicators and message history

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Architecture

### Database Schema

**FAQs Table**
- Stores knowledge base questions and answers
- Includes categories and keywords for matching
- Supports efficient text search

**Support Sessions Table**
- Tracks user conversations with status
- Records escalation reasons
- Maintains activity timestamps

**Conversation Messages Table**
- Stores complete message history
- Links to sessions via foreign key
- Includes metadata (confidence scores, matched FAQs)

### Backend API

REST endpoints powered by Supabase Edge Functions:

- `POST /chat` - Send messages and receive AI responses
- `GET /sessions?userId={id}` - Retrieve user's conversation history
- `GET /history?sessionId={id}` - Get messages for specific session

### LLM Integration

The system uses intelligent response generation with:

1. **FAQ Matching**: Searches knowledge base using question similarity and keyword matching
2. **Contextual Responses**: Analyzes conversation history to provide relevant follow-ups
3. **Escalation Detection**: Monitors conversation patterns and user requests
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Tracks response quality and triggers escalation when needed

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

4. Database migration is already applied to your Supabase instance

5. The Edge Function `support-chat` is already deployed

### Running the Application

Development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

Preview production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Usage

### Starting a Conversation

1. Open the application
2. Type your question in the chat input
3. The AI will respond based on the FAQ database or provide contextual assistance
4. Continue the conversation - the bot remembers your previous messages

### Viewing History

1. Click "View History" in the header
2. See all your past conversations with status indicators
3. Click any session to resume the conversation

### Escalation

The bot will automatically escalate when:
- You ask to speak with a human agent
- Your query can't be resolved after several attempts
- A complex issue is detected

You'll receive a notification that a human agent will contact you within 24 hours.

## LLM Prompts & Response Generation

The system uses a multi-layered approach for generating responses:

### 1. FAQ Matching
```
Match user query against knowledge base using:
- Direct question similarity
- Keyword matching from predefined arrays
- Confidence scoring for response quality
```

### 2. Contextual Analysis
```
Analyze conversation history to:
- Understand user intent
- Provide relevant follow-up information
- Detect repeated or unresolved queries
```

### 3. Escalation Logic
```
Trigger escalation when:
- Keywords detected: "speak to human", "agent", "manager", "complaint"
- Unresolved query count >= 3 in single session
- Low confidence score on multiple responses
```

### 4. Fallback Responses
```
For unmatched queries, provide:
- Topic-based suggestions (pricing, refunds, shipping, account)
- Available FAQ categories
- Request for clarification
```

## Key Features Explained

### Conversational Memory

Each message is stored in the database with session tracking. When generating responses, the system:
1. Retrieves all previous messages in the session
2. Passes conversation history to the response generator
3. Uses context to provide coherent, relevant answers

### Session Tracking

Sessions are created automatically when a user starts chatting:
- Unique session ID generated on first message
- User ID stored in localStorage for persistence
- Last activity timestamp updated with each message
- Status changes tracked (active → escalated/resolved)

### Escalation Simulation

The system simulates real customer support escalation:
- Detects user frustration or complex queries
- Updates session status to "escalated"
- Records escalation reason for human agents
- Notifies user of estimated response time

## Evaluation Criteria
